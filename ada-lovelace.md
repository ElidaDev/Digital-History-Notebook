Ada Love

Ada Lovelace made early advancements in the computer space by describing how to program the Analytical Engine. She made very detailed annotations about how it could be made to compute Bernoulli numbers. She annotated Luigi Federico Menabrea's Book about the analytical engine. She was called the first computer programmer. The reason for this is because she made a program for Charles' prototype. The analytical machine was essentially the first machine calculator. Ada contributed majorly to the machine with her translations. Ada was commemorated with the first language being called Ada.
